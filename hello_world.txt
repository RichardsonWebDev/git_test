Hello world, 

I am a student of the Odin Project. I am currently learning Git basics or the basic Git workflow, as 
they call it. I feel like I am in over my head learning this stuff - Git, terminal/command line, and 
committing my work to the repository on GitHub, but I am going to remain optimistic. I know I'll learn 
all that needs to be learned to become a successful web developer, I just have to maintain motivation 
and perservere whenever I feel like giving up! 

Thanks for reading!
Brittany
